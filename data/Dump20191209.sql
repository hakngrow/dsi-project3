Very immersive, good variety of things to do and eat, and in general a must do for Star Wars fans. \n\nHere are the 5 things I liked the most, followed by the 5 things I disliked or thought it could be improved in the future.\n\nPositives:\n\n* Characters casually walking around the place makes the experience more immersive. At one point I found myself staring at Rey for 5min while she fixed her speeder. Stormtroppers were awesome and interacted a lot with the crowd.\n\n* Smugglers Run is a great ride. Even if you don\'t like 3d simulators, just the fact that you go inside of the Falcon makes it worth it. Lines are crazy long, but worth the wait.\n\n* Oga\'s Cantina is awesome! They nailed the aesthetics and atmosphere of the place! \n\n* Droid Depot is one the best experiences in the park hands down. It\'s not cheap... $100 to build a droid can be a bit pricy for some of us, but omg I had tons of fun choosing what droid to build and putting it together. Also, R2D2 picking on people visiting the store was hella funny.\n\n* Shopping/Merch variety is impressive. Many of the items are exclusive to those stores and definitely unique! Savi\'s Lightsaber build experience is awesome!!! Again, pricy, but an unique experience\n\nNegatives:\n\n* There weren\'t enough aliens. I understand the challenge of making them look good, but some races could definitely be replicated. This was specially disappointing in Oga\'s cantina.\n\n* We need an imperial/first order ride. Balanced as all things should be.\n\n* Not enough Mandalorian merch/gear to purchase. I\'m don\'t even mean Baby Yoda stuff, but Mandalorian stuff in general, like shirts, helmets, etc. \n\n* We need holograms to be present in some areas.

Shortly after this Snoke says \"there has been an awakening,\" which could be the fact that Rey has finally left Jakku and is fulfilling her destiny. \n\nThe Last Jedi also proved to us that Snoke was powerful, but still didn\'t know everything. I think it\'s important that the new films set up the fact that Kylo Ren and others (even Snoke)  aren\'t aware that Vader (Anakin) ultimately defeated the Emperor. Last Jedi expands on this by challenging old myths about light and dark. (Or maybe they do know but are aware that the Emperor survived?)\n\nI hope we find out more about who Snoke is/was but ultimately I think he may just be Snoke, a powerful being who was acting on his own. But I do think that Rey is the reincarnation of \"Skywalker.\" The Virgin birth in Phantom Menace implies that Anakin came from the force, at least partially. I think the direction that the Mandolorian is going in as well may lead to the idea of Yoda being reincarnated as the baby Yoda creature (since it takes place after ROJ and Yoda is a Force ghost in Last Jedi and he is supposed to be the only one of his kind).  however, I think like with Rey, it is not the same exact person as before, as this would be impossible for Yoda to be reborn AND be a force ghost; I think it\'s somehow the spirit of that person surviving.\n\nI actually think this would be a strong storytelling choice and would wrap up the Saga nicely; also could potentially be a way to bring Anakin back briefly in ghost form or somwthing and for Rey to communicate with him and others and for him to find further redemption. I think this would be a fantastic way to \"bring together all three trilogies\" (as J.J. Abrams said they were going to do)--if this happened, I\'m sure they would get Hayden Christiansen back, at least briefly).\n\nAnd finally to support this, Luke says in the ROS trailer \"A Thousand Generations live in you now.\" I could be wrong, but just my thoughts!',NULL,NULL,1,'2019-12-06 01:17:44',NULL,NULL),('t3_e6r91d','StarWars','Which one of you was this?','',NULL,NULL,1,'2019-12-06 01:21:16',NULL,NULL),('t3_e6rb4v','StarWars','Was looking at this set of Star Wars mugs and noticed TWO Attack of the Clones mugs and no Empire Strikes Back.

The Force affects the world around it by emitting an energy field.\n\nIn the Star Wars universe, there appears to be some kind of inherent nature of living cells to be capable of producing a kind of force on the world around it, much the same way in which atoms are bound together through electromagnetic forces. \n\nExcept this kind of force comes from living cells (or perhaps the atoms that make up living cells once combined correctly) and exerts a binding force on the universe keeping it intact, fighting the effects of entropy. Thus it is fitting that the Force comes from life itself, and it is this nature of the Force that is called the Living Force.\n\nThe term used for this by the Jedi before the time of the films was Potentium.\n\nThe Potentium is neither light nor dark, and is not an external but rather internal force that binds, and exists within living cells.\n\nAs life began to flourish in the universe from the Wellsprings of Life (I have to assume that there is more than one as there are many galaxies in the universe) the bindings of the Force grew far and wide, creating a kind of neural pathway of force across the universe (perhaps there may even be more than one \"Force\" if these pathways do not extend universally from one side to the other of the universe).\n\nIn this, the Force (The Cosmic Force) is kind of like a Boltzmann Brain: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_brain\n\nThrough Midi-chlorians that exist within the cells of all living organisms, the Force is able to communicate with living beings and if they have enough Midi-chlorians, and are listening, the voice is loud enough that some may be able to hear it clearly and allow it to work through them to manipulate the energy field that life exerts on the universe.\n\nThe louder the voice (more Midi-chlorians) the more clear the instructions. Through training one can learn to understand the Forces voice, in much the same way that you learn a new language through practice.\n\nNow that I have that established, let us deal with the title of this post.\n\nWhat people call the Light and Dark sides of the Force, and the Light and Dark powers of the Force, are in fact not different sides of a whole.\n\nWhat people call the Light Side of the Force is merely the Force. The Dark Side of the Force, is merely a perversion of the Forces will. A Dark Side user perverts the will of the Force with their own to gain power and create destruction. In this, the power that the Forces will tries to exert on the world, let us say, Force Lightning, is perverted into something that destroys life (Potentium) and embraces entropy. As opposed to Electric Judgement, which is merely the will of the Force.\n\nThink of a Force user as a very strong neuron in the brain of the Potentium. When one stops behaving how it should, the neuron damages the brain around it, and becomes the start of a tumour that can also spread to other neurons.

The Dark side has the opposite effect on Anakin. We have seen many change to the dark side in Star Wars between the games, books, comics, shows and movies and all of them are pretty much the same. They are generally \"good people\" then because of some trauma or betrayal or lust for power they lose their inhibitions and just do what they want regardless of morals. They do things the way they feel is most efficient and usually its morally ambiguous at best.\nWhen it comes to Anakin he was already sort of like that (always questioning orders and doing things his own way) but when he goes to the dark side, instead of losing his inhibition, he becomes more discipline and does anything Palpatine orders without question.\n\n2. The level of change he goes through is insane. Most people who change to the dark side are fundamentally the same people just with a more questionable morality. But they have the same goals and basic tendincies that make them who they are. Anakin however goes from wanting to do good, striving to be the best, questioning orders or actions based on their morality to now settling as second fiddle, doing evil with 0 remorse and taking orders without question like some overated enforcer.\n\n3. *Most Important* The speed that he changes from 1 to the other is REDICULOUS and UNNATURAL. I already know some people are gonna say he was on his way to the darkside since \"Attack of the Clones\" but that is not whst i mean. What i mean is He turned in Palpatine because he was a sith and Stopped Mace Windu based on the morality of execution without trial. Its hard to see Anakin, a young man that despite his flaws and feelings tries to do the right thing even if its against orders, go straight to killing his friends and babies without question just because he was told to, on the same day.\n\nThe biggest responce i\'ve seen to the large difference between Anakin and Vader is that \"Vader killed Anakin\" but if that were TRUE he\'d never save Luke and also it would have been after Padme died but he was already completely evil and immoral by the time she died.\n\nAnyways thats how i feel about it and why its totally strange to me.',NULL,NULL,1,'2019-12-06 15:05:37',NULL,NULL),('t3_e6zw47','StarWars','Came across this Darth Vader cat toy at the prop shop I work at ?','',NULL,NULL,1,'2019-12-06 15:05:48',NULL,NULL),('t3_e6zxna','StarWars','I painted baby yoda!

I have decided to give my thoughts on these adaptations in contrast to the films. In this post, I will be comparing the adaptation of A New Hope, released in 1981, simply titled \"Star Wars\"\n\n**The main cast**\n\n* Mark Hamill reprises his role as Luke. There isn\'t really much to say about his performance, he plays it exactly the same as he did in the movie\n* Ann Sachs is absolutely brilliant as Leia, definitely on par with Carrie Fisher herself\n* Perry King as Han Solo doesn\'t work for me.He comes across as a lot more sleazy than Movie-Han, and it doesn\'t suit the character at all. \n* I didn\'t like Bernard Behrens portrayal of Obi-Wan at first, but after a while his interpretation of him grew on me. He feels a lot more like a kind grandpa than the mysterious hermit-mentor that he was in the movie.\n* Anthony Daniels reprises his role as threepio, much like with Luke, there isn\'t much to be said about it\n* Brock Peters does an amazing job as Vader. He mostly comes across with a calm coldness to him, much more than movie-vader, but every now and again he\'ll dip into rage and I love it.\n* Keene Curtis is alright as Tarkin, but I don\'t feel like he brings anything new to table. I wasn\'t really expecting much though, not many actors can top Peter Cushing.\n\n**Improvements over the film**\n\n* The deleted scenes from the movie were written in, as with most adaptations of ANH\n* Princess Leia is given a lot more to do before being captured by the empire, and she seems to be pretty good friends with Captain Antillies \n* We are shown a lot more of Luke\'s frustration with life on tatooine\n* R2-D2 actually sabotages that red R5 unit. Unlike the movie, it\'s not random chance that it\'s motivator blew up (Sadly, that also means it\'s not a [noble sacrifice](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Skippy_the_Jedi_Droid) either)\n* Although he isn\'t mentioned by name (only as \"The king of Alderaan\"), we meet Bail Organa, and we spend a good length of time on Alderaan\'s surface, which made the impending event we all know is coming just a little bit more devistating.\n* Luke has actually heard of the Jedi through stories, he isn\'t completely unaware of events literally 19 years ago\n* We don\'t see Luke\'s immediate reaction to Owen and Beru\'s death, only his description of it when he tells Obi-Wan. It\'s haunting and the fact that he\'s lost everything actually weighs on him.\n* Obi-Wan actually teaches Luke about the Force and Jedi philosophy at multiple points in the drama.\n* Leia\'s reaction to the destruction of her home planet is a lot less calm. She pleads with Tarkin to not do it a lot longer than movie-Leia, and afterwards she is distraught. \n* Obi-wan actively dodges Lukes questions about Vader and Anakin, and it actually feels like Obi-wan is hiding the famous twist.\n\n**Things the Movie did better**\n\n* At first, the writing makes C-3PO seem a lot more genuinely mean spirited towards R2, but by the time they are in the Jawa Sand Crawler, he\'s back to his normal self\n* The Jedi mind trick somehow worked on a droid.\n* We see Vader\'s interrogation of Leia, and I really prefer the mystery of not knowing what he did to her.\n* There is a weird scene where Tarkin considers using the Death Star as a threat to raise himself through political ranks to become an equal to the emperor. Nothing really becomes of it though, and it ust felt like needless filler.\n\nFrom the Death Star rescue onwards, the Drama plays pretty much the same as the movie, so I don\'t really have any notes for that portion of the story. I really would recommend that you listen to it at least once\n\nI\'m not sure when I\'ll get around to making a post about ESB, but it will probably be in a couple weeks\n\nTL;DR: It was good.\n\nEDIT: As I stated in the comments, I\'m not sure if this is the intended purpose of the Audio/Music flair, but it seemed to fit.

Below are some thoughts that I had during the re-watch.\n\nRogue One\n\n	-I wasn\'t planning on watching Rogue One first (my plan was to watch on release order), but I am so glad I did. I think Rogue One adds gravitas to Episode 4 and it connects nicely.\n\n	-I enjoy Cassian and Jyn more on re-watches.\n\n	-Chirrut is amazing. Hands down one of my favorite Star Wars characters. I\'m one with the Force, the Force is with me.\n	\n\nEpisode 4\n\n	-The visual effects are so impressive considering the time the movies were made.\n\n	-The Vader/Obi-Wan fight feels intentionally reserved. My immersion wasn\'t broken considering I had just seen the Rogue One Vader scene.\n\n	-The music is soooooo good. Honestly, the music makes these movies feel so great. Star Wars would not be what it is today without the accompanying score behind it. \n\n	-Knowing that there is only a 19 year gap between Episodes 3 and 4, I thought that the immersion would be broken due to how much things seem different. But actually watching Rogue One right before and having the Prequels in mind, Episode 4 actually comes across as the Empire still trying to gain its full grasp on the Galaxy. The dialogue about dissolving the senate really plays to this. \n\nEpisode 5\n\n	-Empire only gets better with each re-watch.\n\n	-With Last Jedi and Return of the Jedi in mind, I can understand why Luke would become apathetic to the Jedi code. Yoda constantly tries to get Luke to control/deny his feelings, but Luke refuses to fully adhere to this dismissing of feelings. Luke also feels betrayed a bit by Obi-Wan after he discovers Vader is his father. Luke definitely wants to become a Jedi, but he does have some objections to certain aspects of the code and how they acted.\n\n	-The Yoda puppet is actually really impressive. Yoda is easily one of my favorite parts of the movie.\n \n	-In a lot of ways, Empire is just as much Han\'s movie as it is Luke\'s. Han becomes a central figure alongside Luke as opposed to a side character to Luke.\n\n	-I forgot how involved Obi-Wan is in Empire. He shows up quite a bit.\n\n	-Empire also really showcases Leia\'s force sensitivity with Yoda\'s mention and Leia\'\'S connection with Luke at the end. Leia using the Force to save herself in TLJ doesn\'t seem unreasonable, but I do wish that Leia showcased some Force mastery in TFA to show a development.\n\n	-Han and Lando feel like perfect continuations of Ehrenreich and Glover\'s performances in Solo to me. \n\nAnyone else doing a series re-watch in anticipation of Rise of Skywalker?

The story could be similar to the Mandalorian with it focusing on Boba Fett, similar to Solo A Star Wars Story, and other Bounty Hunters and while I have no idea on a good plot for the film I think it would be interesting to see as every Star Wars film so far has been set during a period of war so it would be a unique story to the rest of the films as it could focus on what the Republic, who are backed by the now massive army, could achieve without war.

He was the chosen one and in another article Terrio says they focused heavily on making sure they didn\'t discount his sacrifice in Return of the Jedi. Furthermore, in this article he states how they wanted to tie up loose ends from Episode I-VIII.

Anakin was redeemed but still mourned how he led to his family\'s destruction, Luke and Leia still have to grapple with their father\'s sins and the death of their mother. And Leia has to deal with the fall of her son due to the sins of previous generations. All at the hands of Palpatine.\n\nI would love to see a scene where we see what could have been if Palpatine hadn\'t destroyed the Skywalker family\'s life by seducing Anakin and deceiving him by using the love he had for his wife as his weakness, which in turn led to Padme\'s death and his children\'s suffering.\n\nWith Palpatine\'s death in Return of the Jedi, we were able to see Vader\'s return to the light but in this movie I want to see Palpatine suffer for what he did to the Skywalkers. By bringing him back they have a chance to do that.\n\nNow my little fan fiction of the final scene, a vision of a better tomorrow:\n\nThe Skywalker Saga is complete, Anakin and Padme are at peace and reunited at last. They look out to the horizon, towards the binary suns on Tattooine. Joined by a younger Luke and Leia, the family is together at last, after years of turmoil. Anakin and Padme embrace their children, holding on as to not lose them once more.

It\'s when Rey first makes the connection with Kylo Ren and shoots a hole in one of the huts. After she\'s outside, Grumpy Luke shows up, points at the hole in his wall, and says with a grumpy look and grumpy gesture:\n\n>What\'s that all about?\n\nIt seemed so irrelevant but I couldn\'t stop dwelling on it. At some point, I realized what stood out to me. It\'s that it is so Uncle Owen-y. It\'s Luke capturing Owen\'s character from ANH and playing it back to Rey.\n\nAnd I wonder if there isn\'t something larger there.\n\nRemember, in ANH when Luke first learns of the Jedi and his father, Obi-Wan says of Owen:\n\n>He didn\'t hold with your father\'s ideals. Thought he should have stayed here and not gotten involved.\n\nOwen had the \"don\'t join\" ethic that we see elsewhere in TLJ, and if you really think about it, the Owen connection makes a lot of sense of Luke at this stage in his life.\n\nAll his young life, Luke had it in for his uncle because he held him back, but all the people who pushed Luke forward \"into the mess\" did so for reasons that weren\'t necessarily in Luke\'s best interest. They wanted him to be the hero, the savior--of their mistakes. They wanted him to kill his own father for them. They wanted him to be a symbol and a vessel--rather than his own person.\n\nOwen took charge of him and said fuck all y\'all. I\'m keeping him safe. I\'m letting him live. ANH makes us side with Luke\'s POV, and so we see Owen as this curmudgeon who is being shortsighted/overprotective, but looking back, he\'s got this kind of Snape-like heroism that never gets acknowledged. It\'s just honest and quiet and focused on keeping this kid safe.\n\nI have to imagine that Luke recognized that at some point. That Owen and Beru were his real parents, and---\n\nThat they were the first victims of his Jedi path.\n\nThe Jedi destiny keeps leading to the deaths of innocents, and Luke wonders if the Jedi need to be in the mix of things.\n\nWhen Luke starts his Jedi temple and more close ones end up murdered, he must feel that same guilt that he likely carries with him for Owen and Beru. I\'m not sure I\'ve seen people connect Luke staring at the burning ruins of his temple to the moment when Luke returns to the Lars Homestead to find it on fire. But these are two moments where Luke comes to find the burning ruins of people who have died \"because of him\" and makes a key life decision: one to join the Jedi and another to leave them.\n\nSo, I know that many think it\'s so out of Luke\'s character to \"step away\" from it all, but the Owen-ness of him in TLJ gives me this sense that he\'s reverting back to the life he had before getting involved and recognizing that it was more principled than he may have given it credit for. He\'s realizing that the \"yearning to be a hero with a cool weapon who trains to fight evil\" is what started this all, and it\'s better to stop that training process/\"legend-making\" process than to keep fighting the fight. That there could be dignity in refusing the call--rather than cowardice.\n\nYoda comes along to snap him out of that. To say that you can\'t keep the process from repeating itself by just walking away from it because the Force will always fuck you in the end anyway. It\'ll send you a fiery girl and droid with a message all over again, and if you don\'t jump back in, they will with or without you (and they\'ve stolen your books, anyway, so good going). In the end, you have two choices: you can either help them do better with the cycle of violence than you did, or you can do what you\'re doing now and be grumpy. This is why Luke has to see the Leia hologram message again in this movie. It\'s the second time a young woman and a droid have come to him to call him away from the life of a farmer out to \"the mess.\"\n\nAnd this is also, more importantly, why it doesn\'t feel out of character. It feels like a logical movement for him, given his past. He becomes his uncle in a sense--and insofar as Luke\'s story has always been about coming to terms with his father and insofar as his uncle is his other father, he\'s doing that here too and coming to terms with the man who raised him. Owen was Luke\'s father for 18 years, not his uncle. He was more a father to him than Vader. More than Obi-Wan. Rey had no parents. Luke had them, and they died protecting him.\n\nThat he plays the Owen-father role to Rey that Owen played to him makes much more sense than him playing the Obi-Wan role that Han takes on in TFA. It\'s what he knows: *No Jedi business for you! Stay out of it.*\n\nBut, through the help of Yoda, Luke has to learn to let go of what Owen never did--because Owen never had a chance to let Luke go.\n\nThis goes along with the theme of growing beyond our teachers/fathers/parents. Luke comes to terms with what his \"father\" on Tatooine wanted for him but also learns to let go of the fear his uncle had as a parent. To let the new generation face danger and the perils of the Jedi way--and see if they could do better.\n\nThis is why it\'s so important that the binary sunset greets Luke\'s death. It\'s easy to view this moment as just a nostalgic moment for moviegoers to remember Luke\'s first big scene in the original movie. But give it more credit than just a callback. Remember, Luke witnessed the first sunset right after running away from Owen, possibly their last real time together. He looked at the suns to hope for something more than what his Uncle had planned for him; he ends his life a hermit, a farmer like his Uncle, and he dies with peace and purpose--something he never thought he could have on a planet that\'s farther away from \"the center of the universe\" than Tatooine ever could be. From his place in the middle of nowhere, Luke learns both to embrace the life he rejected when Owen offers it to him, and to give Rey the hope that she can become something greater too (the hope that his Uncle was too afraid to offer him).\n\n>\"Where are you going?\" \"It looks like I\'m going nowhere.\"\n\nUltimately, Luke goes back to \"nowhere,\" and he finds the kind of grand purpose that no Jedi ever found while there or anywhere. He both becomes Owen, and as Yoda indicates, \"grows beyond\" Owen. And in doing so, honors him.\n\n\"He has too much of his \\[foster\\] father in him\" in that sense.',NULL,NULL,1,'2019-12-07 01:30:44',NULL,NULL),('t3_e77vkh','StarWars','The Sequel Trilogy is good','',NULL,NULL,1,'2019-12-07 01:32:19',NULL,NULL),('t3_e77vnr','StarWars','Scattering of light','',NULL,NULL,1,'2019-12-07 01:32:30',NULL,NULL),('t3_e77vwa','StarWars','Just got another Vader that’s bigger than my other one, and this is the very first thing I thought of when I put them side by side','',NULL,NULL,1,'2019-12-07 01:33:08',NULL,NULL),('t3_e77y75','StarWars','My local library coming through with the Baby Yoda merch','',NULL,NULL,1,'2019-12-07 01:38:48',NULL,NULL),('t3_e77yas','StarWars','We know what happened to Luke\'s lightsaber after he lost it in episode 5.

The story, the side quests, the spaghetti western style... it’s very well done. And after today’s episode which I watched at 12:30am as soon as it came out and I’m coming up with this theory slightly sleep deprived........ I’ve come to the conclusion that our mystery character at the end of episode 5 is none other than Cad Bane. \n\nContext\nThe timeline of The Mandalorian is roughly 9ABY. This means 9 years after the destruction of the first Death Star. \n\n[The Mandalorian Wookipedia](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/The_Mandalorian_(bounty_hunter))\n\nCad Bane\nCad was the most BA bounty hunter (sorry Boba fans) and definitely went down as a legend in the Star Wars universe. I mean... the dude bombed the Jedi Temple AND robbed the Jedi Temple. The guy was amazing. Also, he was known as a “Gunslinger” and put off strong Wild West vibes with his style. \n\n[Cad Bane Wookipedia](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Cad_Bane)\n\nBackstory\nFollowing the events of The Clone Wars, Cad and Boba teamed up for a rescue mission to rescue a kidnapped child on Tatooine. The episodes never aired so we didn’t get to see the outcome. \nBoba Fett has a close relationship with the Hutts as we see in RotJ when he’s hanging out with them on Tatooine, so it makes sense that he would set up base there.\nThe only context we have of where Cad Bane left off is the four episode series that never aired where he and Boba go on this mission to Tatooine. \nSo with this logic, it’s safe to assume that Cad Bane is on Tatooine. \nAnother reason to reinforce this is that Cad Bane was hired by the Hutts on multiple occasions which hints a good relationship between the two parties. \n\nHow this theory works\nWe have no Canonical ending to Cad Banes story. All we have is this...\n1. He has a positive relationship with the Hutt family. \n2. The Hutt’s basically own Tatooine. Even though Jabba is dead, the Mandalorian episode mentions the Hutt’s which implies they are still in control. \n3. Cad Bane knew Jango Fett. \n4. Cad Bane was set to air in a four episode series where he and Boba Fett pair up to rescue a child from Tuskegee Raiders. \n5. Dave Filoni creates the character of Cad Bane and he loved the character. \n6. Dave Filoni wrote and directed episode 5 of the Mandalorian. \n7. You can hear the spurs of each step the mystery character takes in ep. 5 which hints towards a “western gunslinger”\n8. The episode is titled “The Gunslinger” and I’m guessing that’s not referring to Mando or the young bounty hunter.\n\nConclusion\nThis theory may not get people as hyped up as the prediction that the mystery character is Boba Fett, but I think it’s a lot more realistic. \nCad Bane making a live action appearance would stun SW fans and it makes sense because it’s Dave Filoni.',NULL,NULL,1,'2019-12-07 02:34:18',NULL,NULL),('t3_e78n75','StarWars','Hi-Res version of The Rise of Skywalker\'s international poster\'s key art (3240 x 4324 pixels)','',NULL,NULL,1,'2019-12-07 02:39:56',NULL,NULL),('t3_e78ocz','StarWars','Drew a scene of Jango Fett from the prequels','',NULL,NULL,1,'2019-12-07 02:42:49',NULL,NULL),('t3_e78otf','StarWars','You are locked in a room with Darth Vader, and for whatever reason, his temper with you grows by the minute.

Named after one of the greatest Jedi to serve the Galactic Republic, a veteran War General of the Clone Wars, and master to his idol/grandfather- Darth Vader, aka, Anakin Skywalker. In A New Hope, we first witnessed Obi Wan Kenobi\'s connection to the force and how he is in contact with the world around him. When Alderaan was destroyed, an aghast Obi Wan exclaimed he felt \"a great disturbance in the force\" and becomes clearly distraught and emotionally weakened by the disasters transpiring. As we\'ve seen with many characters - including Yoda, Obi Wan, Qui Gon, Snoke, Luke, Finn (on Takodana) and Kylo Ren himself - force users have great connection to life across the galaxy. \n\n\n\nIn The Force Awakens (TFA), Kylo Ren is first shown with INCREDIBLY STRONG force powers; these were strong enough to stop augmented forms of light itself (the laser blast Poe shot) and fully paralyze and invade the minds of others. However, we then come to the scene with the destruction of the Hosnian System and the New Republic.\n\n\n\nThere MUST be a reason Kylo had his mask on, not as in in-movie reasons, but directorial reasons. JJ CHOSE to have Kylo\'s face reveal be in the presence of Rey, however, I ALSO believe he chose to have Kylo wearing his mask during the system\'s destruction to mask what he was truly feeling inside. Kylo stated to his grandfather\'s melted face that he felt the light pulling him before the system\'s destruction, however, he then says he is being \"torn apart\" while talking with Han, a much more intense feeling rather than pure conflict. \n\n\nBen Solo felt great emotional loss from the Destruction of the Hosnian System- a decision he had no part in.

Taikas character (which I don’t think this is a spoiler cause it happened in episode 1 and everyone already knows about baby Yoda), had such a cool freakin design- and he died after like 5 minutes. Weathers character- what is his character again? Just some random guy who gives the Mandalorian jobs sometimes? And then the old farmer creature, who imo is the highlight, comes in for two episodes but that’s it? Every single week we get introduced to a character, and before we can actually care about them- episode over onto next week and the new batch of characters our hero interacts with. And this keeps going on. I mean at the end of this weeks episode (like very end) I guess that changed a bit (no spoilers), but still. \n\nAlso- what is the storyline supposed to be of this entire thing? Outside of baby Yoda (which is like the whole running from other bounty hunters who want him thing), what other storylines do we have?

And while I can still point to things that I dislike, Luke\'s story isn\'t one of them at all. You can see, it\'s clearly narrated in the flashback, that Luke immediately felt shame when he ignited his saber. And if Ben hadn\'t seen him, we all know he would have left and began putting all of his effort into trying to help him and save him from Snoke. But that\'s not the story and that\'s not the point. There needed to be a reason why Luke was isolated on that island for years while the galaxy suffered. (Thanks a lot for setting that one up J.J.)\n\nThe story is that Luke made a mistake in a moment of high emotions. It\'s no different than when Vader threatened Leia. He gave into his anger and emotions and attacked. Had he not seen Vader\'s hand, heard the Emperor taunting and come to his senses he would\'ve killed him. But he ultimately resisted. Actually Luke is shown to act solely on emotion several times in the OT. For example, he rushed back to the homestead against Obi-Wan\'s warning as soon as he thought Uncle Owen and Aunt Beru might be in danger. And he disobeyed Yoda to try to save his friends. But he wasn\'t ready for the fight or the truth about Vader and it cost him a hand. There were consequences. \n\nWe know he wasn\'t going to kill Ben, but he still made the mistake. Luke said he had sensed the darkness building and could see that his heart was already turned. He saw the future of Ben and the death and destruction that he would bring. Of course he was tempted to stop it there and then! But it was just a moment, a \"fleeting shadow\" that went as quickly as it came. Unfortunately when Ben saw him with the saber he didn\'t know that he wasn\'t actually going to do anything. All he saw was that his uncle was about to murder him. So yes Luke had to suffer the consequences for that moment as well. I actually believe that the future Luke was seeing only came to pass in reality BECAUSE of his reaction, by igniting that saber. \n\nThe point is that Luke IS still Luke, not some perfect superhero figure. He can still be impulsive and act on emotion. He\'s still human, still looking to the horizon instead of what\'s in front of him. He can still make mistakes. Luke\'s whole arc in this film is about humanizing him, not playing into this expectation that he was going to be an overpowered God. And by the end he does ultimately realize that he has to pass on what he\'s learned, including his failures.

I hope you stick around to here me out but, Episode III Revenge of the Sith is my second favorite and here\'s why.\n\nIt is NOT the best acted. It is by far not the best. \nBut it redeems Episodes I, and II. In a way that I don\'t believe that any other sequel has done. And I know that Hayden Christensen can be considered cringe worthy during his earlier scenes in the movie. But in my opinion, he conveys amazing emotion in the darker scenes. Hayden\'s portrayal was very polarizing. He was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Actor and won a Razzy for Worst Actor. Anyway best scene in Episode II is when he slaughters the Tusken Raiders. When Sidious convinces him to kill Count Dooku in the beginning of III, He says \"It isn\'t the Jedi way.\" He believes it was wrong. But when Mace Windu attempts to kill Sidious, he believes the Jedi are just as bad as the Sith, that they are just two sides of the same coin. Which in a way, they are. In Episode VIII, Luke says \"That there can be no Dark, without Light.\" Obi Wan Kenobi\'s character growth in the movie is great. Probably the best acted role in the entire Trilogy. I personally love the darkness of this movie. In the original cut they showed Anakin killing all of  the Younglings, not just a short security recording. And technically Anakin being burned alive is gore (They got away with it though). I don\'t think Star Wars will ever reach this level of intensity (But that is opinion). And let\'s be honest, Anakin and Obi Wan\'s battle is THE GREATEST fight in all of Star Wars, and one of the greatest of all time. You could eliminate all of the dialogue and still feel the emotion in it. And holy shit, the choreography... It was beautiful and, expansive. I LOVED IT. And the parallel to Episode I with Obi Wan and Darth Maul. It\'s how Obi Wan knew how to stop it. And finally, yes James Earl Jones\' drawn out \"Noooooo\" was cheesy and forced, but then again Luke\'s \"That\'s impossible!\" in Episode V is the same. \n\nThis is a discussion.

I was waiting for the inevitable save, whether by Anakin or the Republic turning up at the last second, but when it didnt come and Maul impaled her on the darksaber, I was a bit shocked. She has been a semi-prominent character throughout the series, especially to Obi-Wans character development arcs, so it was refreshing to see them take such a left turn.\n\nThe crowning achievement of this episode though, Sidious. The way he decides that Maul has grown too big to ignore and just sets about completely dismantling Mauls plans with basically zero effort was amazing. I love it when Star Wars steps up and reminds you that there is a reason why Palpatine goes on to establish a Galactic Empire near single handedly. The saber fight is just Palpatine stretching his legs and getting in some good practice. I mean, theres parts of the fight when Savage is giving it his all and Sidious doesnt even have his sabers ignited.

I know this has gotten probably a lot of attention but I am curious to see what you guys think. Obviously, we will find out more when the movie comes out but I think with bringing Palps back they are kind of rewriting Star Wars as everything we have known stated Anakin brought balance to the force by killing the Jedi and then killing Palpatine which brough a balance. It seems like there might have been balance for a time but if Palps was actually alive then the dark side was probably stronger than the light as Palps still probably would have been more powerful than Luke.

For this group, the movies are almost like a literal window into another universe, so things like the hyperspace ram and flying Leia really bother them because they do require a bit of looking past for the sake of wonderment. They require you to believe even if it doesn\'t necessarily make sense. A lot of this group tends to think of Rogue One as proper Star Wars because of the \"realism\" of the third act. This group also seems like to have been, on average, much more attached to the old EU, which I think between the cutaway books and the level of detail they went into with how things \"work\" in SW.\n\nThen there\'s the other camp who tends to think of SW more as a fantasy fable or fairy tale, akin to Labyrinth or Neverending Story, or the Bible even. To this group, the mechanical stuff and internal logic is much less important than themes, characters, and most importantly, how the movie makes you feel.. This group feels elation at the previously mentioned moments that require you to believe. I also think I\'ve noticed this group tend to more frequently recognize the franchise as movies first, expanded universe second, and identifies more with the way Star Wars relates to older media to elicit an emotional response (as in, Tattooine scenes reflecting The Searchers, TJL reminiscent of Rashomon). I also think this group is more willing to forgive logic leaps if the thematic payoff is worth it.\n\nObviously these aren\'t hard lines in the sand but more generalizations and correlations I feel like I\'ve noticed amongst people. I almost feel like a lot of the criticisms I see, come off as if they\'re from a person in one camp who can\'t understand why a part of the movie worked (or didn\'t work) for people in the other camp. I don\'t personally think either is necessarily right or wrong, I think Star Wars is at its best when it is able to accomplish both at the same time - like Yoda lifting the X-Wing in the swamp. (I will clarify that personally, I\'m much more satisfied by emotional payoff than by science fiction accuracy. Im willing to just believe what is happening on screen, as long as I feel like it\'s thematically meaningful.)\n\nAnyway, I just thought I\'d share, because I think approaching things this way might help us see why we don\'t always see eye to eye.

One book to the next to the next you will see subtle or drastic differences in what the Jedi/Sith could do and what the force was capable of. \n\nTo some like Zhan the force is a subtle thing. Something that is more like a buff to natural abilities along with letting you see the future and guide you. \n\nWhile to others like Kevin J Anderson or Filoni the Force is this mystical power that can bend time, destroy stars, and alter reality in any way the author can imagine. \n\nWhile their is a lot of space in between those two extremes I do think it would be interesting to see where people think other authors in legends and canon would fall on that line if given a Jedi involved story. \n\nFor example I had been wondering where Claudia Grey would land as she seemed to fall into the Zhan camp of how SW works.

He comes off to me as a passive aggressive, condescending hypocrite.  For someone who claims they hate complainers, he sure made a lot of videos complaining about the prequels, George Lucas, the EU, and the fandom.  He also does a lot, and I mean A LOT of strawman arguments.  I looked at his twitter and saw this one tweet: https://twitter.com/hellogreedo/status/1001031721062752256?lang=en and I thought he was arguing with someone.  He wasn\'t.  He literally writes tweets that look like responses to arguments.  It\'s like he\'s arguing with some invisible person.  And his \"How Luke should have been in TLJ\" just came off as some sort of condescending trigger topic.  It\'s like he wants to get people mad in the comments so he can make a video acting like some calm, level headed, reasonable person.  He farms hate comments and then plays the victim of how “EvErYoNeS OuT To GeT Me”, which is weird, as I haven’t found a single piece of negative feedback about him.  All of his twitter responses and video comments are just an echo chamber.  I respect the fact, however, that he is able to work on youtube while taking care of his daughter.\n\n- Star Wars Theory: I\'ve had an up and down relationship with this guy.  I thought his earlier videos were entertaining, and then he resorted to making overly clickbait titles and thumbnails.  That kind of lowered my respect for him, but his more recent videos have stopped doing the clickbait shit.  His fanfictions are interesting, and his Vader fan film was amazing.  Overall, his main videos are decent, but the videos where he tells a story  that he came up with himself are great.  He seems like a creative guy who wants to tell a story.  And yeah, his lore videos are just him reading off of Wookiepedia, but let\'s be honest, would you rather read words on a website, or have someone with a relatively soothing voice read them to you?\n\n- Star Wars Explained:  He seems ok, but sometimes, I find his videos boring.  He mostly just covers the lore, which is fine, but some of his videos come off as bland.  Also, whenever he tries talking about the sequels, he starts pulling out stupid arguments that make no sense.  But for the most part, his videos are ok.\n\n- OverlordDVD:  I have mixed feelings about this guy.  I think his “future ruler of earth” thing and the fact that he made up a story for himself is interesting, and kind of charming.  Whenever he makes a video discussing a rumor or leak, they seem far fetched, but he has the decency to remind us to take what he says with a grain of salt.  I also think whenever he makes an actual review, he has some good jokes, and interesting opinions.  He’s also pretty active with his fans and Patreon patrons.  I also appreciate that he doesn’t try to be edgy every other sentence.\n\n- Mike Zeroh:  I cant with this guy.  OverlordDVD is good enough to say his rumors may not be true, but not Mike Zeroh.  He preaches some seriously ludicrous shit as if it’s confirmed fact.  I don’t know how he is off camera, but I don’t like his videos, they come off to me as tabloids.  Also, whenever he’s talking in a video, he sounds like he doesn’t want to be there.\n\n- Geeks and Gamers:  I don’t find his videos interesting.  I don’t hate them, I just think he kind of comes off as a fedora tipping edgelord.  That’s about it, I’m not really interested in his channel.\n\n- Thor Skywalker:  I like Thor Skywalker.  Whenever he has an opinion or criticism he always has logical reasons to back it up.  When he dislikes something, he explains why.  A lot of people on this sub bash him a lot, I never understood why.\n\nSo what do you guys think?  Do you agree with what I said?  Do you have another Star Wars Youtuber I should have talked about?

We dont see  this in the prequels.\n\nPiloting: We see him accidentally destroy a navy. And say a bunch of complicated mumbo jumbo.\n\nIn TCW, we actually see him do smart and intelligent feats, as well as pull of strategies that otherwise wouldnt have worked. How he destroys admiral trenches ship, for example.\n\nRelationship with obi wan: we see them actually chat and joke around. We see them banter and care about each other, they fight together. They argue, but they dont trash each other or verbally spare like 90% of the prequels. \n\nCunning warrior: an interesting detail in TCW is that everytime we see anakin fight another force sensitive, we see him have a easier time every time. Especially with dooku. He used to struggle with dooku in season 1 and 2 but by season 5 we can see that dooku and anakin are even. \n\n\nAnother great detail is the clones:\n\nWe follow this small squad from kamino all the way to being arc troopers.

I completely expect this to get a handful of views, many downvotes, some flame comments, and it for it to be dead on arrival. That being said, I’m writing this because I feel very solid about this theory and I want to put it out there before RoS comes out in case I’m right, which is why I marked it as spoilers just in case.*\n\nLet’s get to it:\n\nThere is no shortage of “Snoke is actually Plagueis theories online”. I’m well aware of this. What I’m here to offer is my take/version of what this *means*. \n\nPalpatine tells Anakin that his master, Darth Plagueis, was able to “stop people from dying”. This was a bit reductive of him but it got the point across at the time. My theory is that Snoke is actually Snoke, or at least what was left of him. Snoke could have been a senator or dignitary or all around wealthy individual (the golden, opulent robes are key). This Snoke fellow either knew Palpatine and Plagueis, or didn’t, and upon his death either willingly or unwillingly gave up his body to Darth Plagueis’ force ghost to use as a vessel. \n\nI’m going to pause for a moment here. No doubt, the 8 people reading this are thinking two things: “ok, go on” or “that’s not how the force works”. To the latter I would suggest looking at some of the Legacy fiction. In this case, or at least what inspired this idea, is the MMO, Star Wars the Old Republic. In the expansion about the Infinite Empire, the emperor is killed and his force ghost inhabits your body and stays with you for the duration of the story. I won’t go into more in case people want to experience that story. That being said, using the force in this way has been established in Legacy cannon which is slowly being pulled from in new cannon. Now to continue. \n\nJ.J. has stated that IX will tie all previous films together so let’s go back to Episode III and what I *think* Plagueis’ motivation is. Since in *this* theory Plagueis’ method to stop people from dying involved inhabiting a living vessel as a force ghost his motivation would be to find a suitable, powerful vessel. The original intended vessel was Anakin Skywalker with his “mighty Skywalker blood”. Unfortunately Obi-Wan ruined that body on Mustafar so that was off the table and like a good, patient Sith Plagueis waited...\n\nFast forward to VI. Sidious instructs Anakin, now Vader, to bring Luke before him so he can potentially turn him. Perhaps this is because the vessel needs to be willing? Or the vessel needs to be attuned to the dark side? Luke was the second choice but agai, the plan was foiled and Palpatine “dies”. \n\nI’m going to kind of pause again here for a minute. Assuming this theory is correct so far we know that eventually Plagueis comes back in Snoke’s body. Maybe Plagueis and Sidious had an agreement that when one falls the other returns in order to ensure the Sith legacy lives on. This idea perpetuated by the fact that Sidious is clearly coming back in IX now that Plagueis is “dead”. Alright, back to it. Also, Mandalorian spoilers ahead. \n\nSo Sidious is dead, the bulk of the Empire falls. In the Mandalorian we see the roots of the First Order working from the shadows. The Mandalorian is hired to bring back a baby of Yoda’s species, a species clearly extremely force sensitive. In the third episode you heard Wernor Herzog’s character say, “extract what you need and dispose of it” in reference to the child. I *think* that the Empire/First Order are extracting various genetic materials to make a clone/synthetic body for Plagueis. They have deep pockets because Snoke is so wealthy and believes in the cause. At some point this doesn’t work, or can’t happen, or does work. Maybe Snoke was that genetically engineered vessel. Or maybe it didn’t come together in time and Snoke’s body was a last ditch effort, hence why he appears to be so weak. Maybe they made several genetically manufactured vessels and planted them in the worst parts of the galaxy so they could grow up feeling hatred thus predisposing them to the dark side. \n\nAt any rate the First Order rises and “Snoke” turns Ben Solo to the dark side.  Unfortunately Kylo Ren is wildly unstable. Sure he has the “mighty Skywalker blood” but he is erratic and unbalanced, going so far as to crack his kyber crystal when creating his lightsaber. Then Plagueis feels an “awakening” in the force. One of his vessels, Rey, has awoken her force potential. \n\nPause time! Yes, I think Rey is either a clone or a genetically modified body created using clone technology. I’ve seen this theory tossed around because of her scene in TLJ where she sees infinite duplicates of herself. She’s one of many but *she* has awoken. And by the way, I’m pretty sure Anakin was the same thing. Plagueis has been at this for a *looooong* time. \n\nKylo may or may not be aware of Plagueis’ plan. He does say, “WHAT GIRL?” in TFA almost as though he is aware and threatened by his competition for Plagueis’ favor. In TLJ Rey comes willingly to the throne room because Plagueis manipulates both her and Kylo into being open to trusting one another. Disappointed with Kylo, Rey is the prize. The perfect vessel. Powerful in the force. All he needs is her corpse to possess and it’s a done deal but Kylo cuts him in half instead, tired of being used. Rey and Ren split ways and we go into IX in a couple of weeks. \n\nSidious returns either by the same possession theory or a different kind of force magic akin to the Night Sisters of Dathomir. I’m not sure where the Knights of Ren fit into this. Maybe an ancient Sith cult charged with continuing Plagueis’ legacy. I believe all this, or most of it, could very well be revealed in Episode IX. Rey finds that she never had parents OR the parents she had really were the junkies Kylo mentioned, they just didn’t know she wasn’t truly their child. It’s up to her to become her own person and fend off the darkness taking her over (as teased in the trailer) no doubt a plan of Plagueis’. \n\nThat about sums it up. I know this theory has holes and is very nebulous. I doubt every detail will be 100% accurate but this is the framework. If you read this, thanks for your time.! :)\n\nTL;DR: Plagueis can possess bodies with his force ghost and has been searching for/trying to create the perfect vessel to  inhabit.',NULL,NULL,0,'2019-12-08 03:22:39',NULL,NULL),('t3_e7ohgz','StarWars','Yay Fortnite','',NULL,NULL,0,'2019-12-08 03:24:54',NULL,NULL),('t3_e7oind','StarWars','Chosen One/ Ep. 9 Theory (Mando spoilers)','Hey there!

That should put him around ~75 years old during Ep 9. Anakin brought balance to the force, but only in the sense that the number of sith = the number of jedi. Any Jedi that were anticipating the chosen one arriving could have mixed up their force-related premonitions of the chosen one being Anakin with BY, who was coexisting in a much more dormant state. \n\nHowever, perhaps BY works its way into Ep. 9 as the chosen one. Rey and Kylo have both flirted with the idea of abandoning the Sith/Jedi dynamic. Perhaps BY becomes the balancing influence to both, abolishing the jedi and the sith, creating grey-jedi-type force users that are themselves balanced in their use of the force. We saw BY’s power when saving Mando, it stands to reason that it’d be more powerful than Rey/Kylo as it matures/trains.  \n\nStar Wars has always been political.

Sure the OT was directed by three people, but at least they added to a three-piece puzzle that was somewhat mapped out by George in the beginning. Unlike the Middle Earth Legendarium, which was created and thoroughly thought ought by one person over several years and there is NO compromises to his vision, Star Wars has been a never ending string of retconning and backtracking. I’m not saying there aren’t good things passed the OT. I love the video games, CW2003, TCW, Rebels, TFA, and TLJ. But the problem is that (please don’t hate me, yes I think the sequels are better), George kinda fucked EVERYTHING beyond repair with the prequels. Yes I like the memes, but as movies and how they fit into the “lore” and “mythos” of what the original trilogy created, they’re kinda awful. And bc that’s what new writers have to work with, OF COURSE the rules and shit of this world will constantly be backtracking, confusing, and contradicting. The reason I love CW2003 is that while it is a setup for a larger story, at least the story it tells stands on its own, does its own thing, and is at least well written, unlike the prequels. Of course this is just my opinion and if you do enjoy the stuff that I don’t, that’s great and more power to u.

Will they integrate republic systems in their new order or just burn them to the ground. Just some questions if answered would shed some light of the size of the first order and the plans the first order have. \n\nThis questions can easily be answered with a small conference scene. The first order recycles many uniforms of the empire so seeing multiple admirals via holograms would mean that their are multiple fleets, seeing a someone sitting in a uniform like yullaran would mean their is an intelligence network. Hearing someone say to a admiral proceed with the invasion/liberation(Don\'t know what first order officers think of what they are doing)of .... world. Would mean a they are actively taking over the galaxy. Someone saying moff/governor means they are having the same bureaucratic structure as the empire or maybe they have something new and it can be mentioned with a line. Such a scene could have been played at starkiller base or in the big star destroyer in the last jedi. I think such a scene would be really good for explaining the first order and seeing that they have a plan in place what to do with the galaxy. Maybe have the scene with the viewpoint of Hux walking though the room and end it with a transmission that snoke wants to speak with him. \n\nThe movies are just lacking with the first order and what they are.

The biggest problem with this trilogy is that they didn\'t have the whole trilogy planned out. I remember reading that Abrams didn\'t actually had an explanation to who Rey\'s parents are after EP.7, in order to leave it up to the directors/writers of EP. 8 and 9. This is a huge mistake. They should have had at least some layout fot how things should go. Another problem is that they went from Abrams to Johnson and back to Abrams. \n\nI was actually one of the few that loved The Last Jedi. Sure, it has some big problems, but I loved it overall. I wasn\'t at all mad with how they portrayed Luke as I always saw him as a flawed character, not this beacon of light that could do no wrong (for example leaving Yoda\'s teaching in ESB and using anger against Vader in ROTJ) and I also loved what they did with Kylo. The issue is that after Abrams came back, he\'ll probably ignore most, if not all of Johnson\'s ideas. I know this would anger a lot of people, but I think to preserve the continuity they should have let Johnson to do Ep. 9 as well or let Abrams do all 3 episodes.\n\nOverall this is most likely the fault of Disney/Kathleen Kennedy trying to rush these movies not allowing enough time for planning and outlining the story. When they saw the backlash to EP. 8 they just panicked and tried to cobble together something that will undoubtedly let down a lot of people.\n\nI wish Disney didn\'t concetrate so much on making this movies so kid-friendly and tone down the jokes....a lot. EP. 7 had WAY too many jokes and it really bothered me. EP. 8\'s opening with Hux was downright unbearable to watch, but luckily after that there was way less of them, I liked that and it actually got very dark. I think it\'s one of the reasons why the new characters feel so bland and uninteresting. All Finn does is yell, while Rey\'s default state is the \"a deer in the headlights\". The fact that they are paired with the characters from the original trilogy doesn\'t help at all, as it is really obvious which ones are the more interesting and leaves the new characters less space for character developing and actually making the audience care about them.

First, Rex has never hidden his clone identity, taking pride in it and loves recounting his war stories. It\'s rare enough to find a clone in active Imperial service by the time of the OT, let alone one fighting for the Rebellion. He was part of the forces who joined Mon Mothma at the official founding of the Rebellion. I\'m sure most soldiers deployed at Rebel HQ and the entire leadership knows they\'ve a clone captain/commander among their ranks. General Hera does, as does Mon Mothma. No reason to think General Leia nor Luke don\'t.\n\nAt the same time, the entire Rebellion knows THE Luke Skywalker, that lightsaber-wielding slayer of Death Stars, even if they\'ve never met him personally. People who\'ve never seen him in action, who\'ve never met a Jedi, who don\'t believe the legends may underestimate him. But not Rex. He knows the Jedi of old. He fought besides them for the Republic. He has seen what the Jedi are truly capable of. And most importantly, he has fought with a Skywalker. He may not know they\'re related by blood, but Rex sure loves being reminded of the old days.\n\nSo, if the pre-Dagobah Luke (back when he was so excited to hear about the Clone Wars and before he turned all broody) never sought out Rex during break times to ask him about the Clone Wars, they would\'ve met by the Battle of Endor. They\'re both in the same task force infiltrating Endor via the same Imperial transport. Leia would\'ve logically involved Rex in planning the operations due to his experience. Which puts Rex in the rank and position to converse with Luke. It\'s hard to imagine that Rex never reminisced about Anakin when he holds the former in such high regard, especially in the presence of another lightsaber-wielding Skywalker.\n\nI wonder what Luke would\'ve thought about those stories, if Rex had told them to him?

If I am thinking correct, AOTC is 3 years before ROTS, then another 19 years to ANH - 22 years. Then 4 years to ROTJ - 26 years, and another 5 to The Mandalorian for 31 years, 19 short of the Child\'s age of 50. I doubt the Kaminoans would have cloned Yoda, leaving about 25 to 30 years for the Empire to clone Yoda. \n\nBut the Kaminoans were able to modify the aging process of clones. It isn\'t too big of a stretch that the Imperial scientists sped up his aging.

But I love writing little things like this, and I do it all the time. I was just thinking about the things I enjoy in the show, I ended up writing this out. I just figured I\'d share it here for the fun of it - and if I can turn even just a single person on to the show and have them enjoy it, all the better.\n\n**WHY YOU SHOULD WATCH “THE CLONE WARS”, THE ANIMATED SERIES**\n\nThe Clone Wars is an animated “kid’s show”, and it admittedly feels like it in the first few episodes. However, as the show goes on, it starts to feel less and less like a show for children and more like… well, *Star Wars*. That’s not to say that Star Wars isn’t for children in general, but this saga has always had an “ageless charm” that appeals to anyone, adult and child alike. And when the show gets going, The Clone Wars is no different. It genuinely feels like a natural part of the Star Wars universe, and it only gets better as it goes on. It’s a must watch for fans of Star Wars, and here are ten reasons why:\n\n**10.** **A massive expansion of the Star Wars universe and its lore -** One of the best things about Star Wars has always been its vast and fascinating universe, and a show like The Clone Wars has a lot more time to explore new parts of that. There are new worlds, technologies, characters, mystical forces (pun intended), creatures, and more information on the history of the universe that those who have only seen the movies are missing out on.\n\n**09. The War Itself -** Something that the prequel trilogy kind of glossed over a bit was the actual Clone War. The war only begins at the very end of the second film, and only really serves as a plot device in the third as it comes to an end. We never really get to see the majority of the war with all its battles, strategies, political challenges, and most importantly the comradery and livelihood of the soldiers. This changes with The Clone Wars, which devotes nearly 50 hours to all of this. You get a much better idea of how massive this war is and how it affected those who lived through it, plus you get a massive chunk of the Star Wars story to boot.\n\n**08. The Clones -** One major highlight of the shows is the clones themselves. They are handled very well, and cease to be just faceless soldiers that we know nothing about. They may be clones, but they are still individuals. They have their own personalities, strengths, and even have their own “style” that sets them apart from each other visually. Some even abandon the war to pursue their own dreams, or even betray the republic out of self interest. But for the most part, they share a sense of unity despite their differences, and they really feel like a family. A few of them become truly fascinating characters, and getting to know these soldiers really enhances the story of this war.\n\n**07. The Jedi Council -** Another thing that the show gets to devote more time towards is the massive cast of characters in Star Wars, including the Jedi Council. You not only get to see more of how they operate, but you get to see more of the characters who were mostly in the background during the films. It’s always cool to see the Jedi in action, and some of the Jedi that we hadn’t seen much of are really interesting characters with a lot of potential… potential that this show gets to explore.\n\n**06. More of Anakin’s Transition -** The films can only show so much, and while Attack of the Clone foreshadows Anakin’s fall to the dark side quite a bit, most of his actual transition takes place in the third film. Taking place in between the two movies, you not only get to see more of this, but it has more of an impact. You get to see how close Anakin and Obi-Wan get, and how great of a warrior Anakin is despite the fact that he’s a bit of a hot-head. It also does a better job than the films in showing the deep relationship he has with Padme. All of this adds to give more weight to Anakin’s inevitable turn (simultaneously making it more believable), and the little moments of the show that hint at this fate are really cool.\n\n**05. Obi-Wan is a Boss -** Something we all already know. Obi-Wan is just awesome, and is easily one of the best characters in the entirety of Star Wars. Being one of the most important characters in The Clone Wars, Obi-Wan gets a lot of time to shine over the course of the show… both as a character, and as a capable general of the war.\n\n**04. Tie-Ins with the Films -** The show is also filled with references, easter eggs, and even straight up connections to the films and other portions of Star Wars canon. I won’t go into spoilers, but it’s safe to say that fans who have seen the rest of the saga will enjoy certain bits of this show. And even when it isn’t directly correlating with what we see in the films, but the show is constantly providing additional background on the places, characters, and events that we have seen in the films.\n\n**03. Palpatine’s Manipulation of the Republic and the War -** We know from the film’s that the entire war was a construct of Palpatine and his rise to power. The Clone Wars shows more of this, and provides a deeper look into the government and its central players during the war. It’s cool to see the pieces moving towards what ultimately happens in Revenge of the Sith, and knowing how Palpatine is manipulating everyone before they know it is very entertaining.\n\n**02. A Deeper Look and the Confederacy of Independent Systems -** In the prequel trilogy, the CIS doesn’t get much focus. It’s interesting to see how much they are being played by Palpatine just like the Republic, even if they have very naturally opposing values as well. Also, there are interesting characters that play a big part in the show that are never featured in the films.\n\n**01. It’s More Star Wars -** It’s over 40 hours of Star Wars story that is generally well received.

He assumes people know most plays in the book ( plot-wise), like himself and other cinephiles do, and he basically speaks to his peers, doing mental gymnastics to outdo expectations, something that works perfectly for \"knifes out\" and other detective stories. This is a playful approach to a piece of \"technical\" knowledge; a tool basically. This is the type of stuff that, people highly educated but not inspired enough to do more expressive artistic work, do; creative stories for their own sake. Its purpose is pure entertainment ( like JJ Abrams works also mostly are), but it\'s a SPECIFIC type of entertainment, dependent on playing with tradition and pushing it to a breaking point, the exact opposite of BUILDING ON tradition; what SW hoped to do in a new trilogy. The symptoms of this opposition arise when SW needs to be more than entertainment: The Last Jedi had its cards stacked against itself in this matter; it could not represent more than entertainment especially when tied to an author not really engaged in much emotional expression. He couldn\'t start now; in a sequel in the third trilogy to a huge franchise, a child of many people and therefore something that was not his own. This was hard level for a noobie, he decided to not buy into a losing fight and instead embraced his strenghts: the intellectual spectacle. (that\'s why it seems a cynical movie to some, it\'s emotionally detached.) Lastly, the spectacle he bet all his money on didn\'t work because it needed to engage in different ways than the one Rian does know how to do. There are different sets of skills in filmmaking. SW, big as it is now, needs spectacle that plays with the intensity of emotion; the epic always relies on a solid context, on stakes that feel more real than necessarily complex (although it can not be so simples it\'s dumb).

I still struggle to understand him.','Hello there!\n\nSo, before I wanna ask my actual question, I wanna elaborate what I do think I get about Vader. Since I\'m not up-to-date as to what\'s considered canon and legends, I might mix those two up a fair bit.\n\nI understand that Vader is a conflicted character. While I initially wasn\'t too hot or too cold on the prequels, I came to respect Haydens work more and more and I seem to have gained an appreciation for his potrayal of the character. In Episode III we witness his fall from a cocky, arrogant but ultimately kind-hearted Jedi to the man who had already defined media in a profound way decades earlier. Seeing Vader in the original trilogy, he seems evil through and through in the first Episode, while the following ones portray him as a fallen hero, a father and ultimately as the savior of the galaxy (with much help from his son). I really liked his transition from this vicious tool to the person he ones was, choosing the right thing to do and giving his life as the ultimate sacrifice for that.\n\nSo Episode III, I think, makes a good effort in explaining his turn to the dark side. After the inital trauma of losing his mother to a savage threat in the Episode prior, he obviously feels tremendously afraid that this could happen again to another person he deeply cares for. Also, the jedi didn\'t seem too capable of dealing with that kind of emotional trauma aside from just distancing themselves from it and advising Anakin to do the same. So it made sense why Anakin felt alone, or even betrayed, by the Jedi Order. That and the disrespect he experienced, of course. So I can definitely see a person, disillusioned with the order he gave much of his life to and afraid of the same horrendous pain he already experienced once, turning to much more drastic measures to save what he wants saved. And while I can kind of understand him killing Windu in a fit of passion and said fear, subsequent cruelties are a bit of a leap for me. But I\'m still along for the ride, even when he butchers children, because it stills fits the characters profile. He was stressed out beyond belief and his psyche was all but broken. But. All the subsequent horrors he inflicted, after Padmes death, make me pause. I just can\'t wrap my head around it. \n\nSo my question would be the following: Why did Vader never leave the emperor, after Padmes death? I know there have been stories bridging Episode III & IV, the Force Unleashed being one where he completely defies the Emperor\'s will and takes on an apprentice. So there definitely was some defiance there. And I\'d guess there are even more comics or books that would shine a light on more rebellious acts from Vader.\n\nBut that\'s all far later. Palpatine \\_told\\_ him, that it seems that he killed Padme in his anger. All the disgusting shit he did, he did to save her. But now she is dead. No reason to keep going. He knows who killed her, he knows why, he (I\'d imagine) would see Palpatines hand in all this; pushing him further and further until he lost control. There should be absolutely no loyalty anymore. He lost everything he ever loved, held dear or stood for. His wife was killed, his children are gone, his order is in ruins and his old self, whatever was left of it, died in flames. The only thing waiting for him from that point onward could only be more pain, more suffering and more cruelty. In short; Padme was dead, no need to \"do what needs to be done\" anymore.\n\nWhy did he not defy the Emperor? Why didn\'t he fight him, even if it meant his death? Why didn\'t he commit sudoku? Why did he keep being loyal to the Emperor for as long as he did, even trying to convert his son to a similar damning existence?\n\nExplanation attempts:\n\n1. The dark side is very seductive and, being a super-natural force, can twist the mind in a way that would make anyone power hungry. I find that a bit of a lazy explanation, however. I\'ve never had the feeling, not even just watching the original trilogy and not taking the prequels into account, that he hungered for power for the sake of power. The further the story progressed, the sadder he seemed to me. Sad and angry. Not gaining power to be powerful, but maybe to fill the void his actions left in his soul. Or simply to not be weak.\n2. The man was broken to begin with. Palpatine did horrible things to him, breaking him even further and putting him back together as he sees fit. Abusing him to the point where he does what he\'s told, never questioning or defying an order, not even IF he would be physically capable of doing so. That must be a horrific place to be in, yet, I can\'t really see it. That kind of abuse takes time. I don\'t see a reason why Vader would grant Palpatine that time. Padme is dead, he himself killed her, \"NOOOOOOOOOOOOUUUUUHHH!!!!\" and all that. It doesn\'t add up to me why he would still continue this existence like he did (or at all). It just didn\'t seem like he was brainwashed enough to become Palpatines slave immediately, once the mask was put on.\n3. Waiting for the right moment. He hated the Emperor, he wanted him dead, he wanted to gain the strength and wait for the right moment. He might wanted to die, but first he wanted revenge for what that monster put him through. Reasonable, I\'d think. It would explain his numb obedience to a great extend, but it falls apart for me in the final confrontation. When he killed Palpatine, it was a liberating moment, not vengeance. And even that liberation needed some sort of a push first, the love for his child being said push. A Vader seeking revenge wouldn\'t have needed that much convincing and I don\'t think he would\'ve displayed as much hesitations as he did, first witnessing his son taking multiple, rather painful, blasts of that famous force lightning before finally stepping up.\n4. Maybe he somehow \"forgot\" his hatred towards Palpatine and seeing his son being tortured re-awakened that part of him, but I could hardly see anyone forgetting to hate Palpatine, if they were in Vaders suit.\n5. He just hated Jedi that much. Yes, sure, I can see that. But he also killed many, many, MANY people that weren\'t Jedi or even affiliated with them. The rebels he fought where normal people. Yes, he had kind of plausible reasons for hating the Jedi Order and it\'s members, but I\'ve never seen it build up that he despised the Republic as much as he had to in order to hunt down the rebels of his own volition. No, he fought the rebels because Palpatine told him to do it and he is loyal to Palpatine. That doesn\'t explain the loyalty question at all.\n\nThat was a bit longer than I may have wanted, but if you read it, you\'re the bomb.
